# orator

a html content sharing platform. Created by nonmasc-lilly.

Orator supports two http requests, HTTP/1.1 GET and HTTP/1.1 POST

Orator uses these to fill a small directory with user generated http
files and share them with other users.

to compile the C file use `make` to build the project into a portable
runnable unit use `make build`
